For Image Conversion:
You can place your original images in the "input_images" folder.
The program will then process these images in two ways:
a) Convert them to ASCII art, which will be saved in the "ascii_output" folder.
b) Create modified versions of the images, which will be saved in the "output_images" folder.

For WhatsApp ASCII Conversion:
There's a script called "asciifriendly.py" that can be used to convert WhatsApp messages into ASCII art.
After running this script, you'll find the ASCII versions of your WhatsApp messages in the "whatsapp_ascii_output" folder.
